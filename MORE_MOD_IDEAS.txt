-Large mineral deposits that require machines to extract (encourages exploration and resource automation with trains and such)
-Minerals are processed into multiple types of ore (more types avaiable with increasing tiers)
-Most metal combinations will create alloys in the smeltery, but the majority of those are waste
-Higher tiers of machines require different processes instead of just swapping out blocks (like increased steel production would require adding an oxygen input)
-Resource costs increase non-linearly via intermediate products
